  \section{Research Interests}
  \begin{description}
      \item{\noindent I research web security and privacy, including browser
          hardening techniques, fingerprinting detection and evasion,
          and measuring how the growth of the Web API has impacted privacy and security.
          This research supports my work building access control systems for
          browser functionality, developing new web application systems
          that provide client-enforced privacy and security guarantees,
          and measuring the harms of online privacy violations.}

  \section{Other Contributions}
  \begin{description}

    \item[Fingerprinting Protection Improvements in Brave Browser] \hfill \textbf{\url{https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop}}\\
    Improved the technique used to block fingerprinting related Web API methods
    to reduce the impact on non-fingerprinting related code, expanded the set
    of blocked Web API methods to cover additional fingerprinting methods, and
    worked with Brave engineers to address vulnerabilities in
    the browser's fingerprinting-blocking technique.

    \item[Web API Hardening Browser Extension] \hfill \textbf{\url{https://github.com/snyderp/web-api-manager}}\\
    Developed Firefox and Chrome extension to improve web privacy and security by
    controlling what browser functionality web sites can access. Web API
    access controls can be defined globally, or on a per-host level,
    to allow only trusted hosts access to privacy-threatening
    functionality, such as high resolution timers, WebGL, and WebRTC.

    \item[Dataset of Web API Use in Alexa 10k] \hfill \textbf{\url{http://imdc.datcat.org/collection/1-0723-8}}\\
    Public dataset documenting what Web API features popular sites use,
    both in a default web browser configuration, and with
    advertising and tracking blocking extensions installed.

    \item[CDF: Abstractions for Security Guarantees in Interactive Web Applications] \hfill \textbf{\url{https://github.com/bitslab/cdf}}\\
    Built client and server-side tools for implementing CDF, a document format for building dynamic, interactive web applications
    that provide increased security and privacy guarantees for users of commodity web browsers.

    \item[Cloudsweeper] \hfill \textbf{\url{https://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu}}\\
    Developed tool to measure and mitigate plaintext password sharing in Gmail archives. The
    tool allows users to redact or encrypt found passwords to reduce the harm
    of account compromise. The site has served over 2,500 users and has
    secured over 38,000 messages.
