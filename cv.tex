  \section{Research Interests}
  \begin{description}
      \item{\noindent I research web security and privacy, including browser hardening techniques and
          measuring how the growth of the Web API has impacted user privacy and security.
          This research supports my work building access control systems for
          browser functionality and tools for deploying web applications that
          provide stronger privacy and security guarantees for users.}

  \section{Other Contributions}
  \begin{description}

    \item[Fingerprinting Protection Improvements in Brave Browser] \hfill \textbf{https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop}\\
    Improved the technique used to block fingerprinting related Web API methods
    to reduce the impact on non-fingerprinting related code, and expanded the set
    of blocked Web API methods to cover five more, previously allowed, methods used for fingerprinting users.

    \item[Dataset of Web API Use in Alexa 10k] \hfill \textbf{http://imdc.datcat.org/collection/1-0723-8}\\
    Public dataset documenting what Web API features are used
    on popular websites, both in a default web browser configuration, and with
    advertising blocking, and tracking blocking, extensions installed.

    \item[CDF: Abstractions for Security Guarantees in Interactive Web Applications] \hfill \textbf{https://github.com/bitslab/cdf}\\
    Built client and server-side tools for implementing CDF, a document format for building dynamic, interactive web applications
    that provide increased security and privacy guarantees for users of commodity web browsers.

    \item[Cloudsweeper] \hfill \textbf{https://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu}\\
    Developed tool to measure and mitigate the frequency of plaintext password sharing in Gmail archives. The public
    tool allows users to redact or encrypt-in-place found passwords. The site has had over 2,500 users and has
    secured over 38,000 messages.
