  \section{Research}
  \begin{description}
    \item[Cloudsweeper] \hfill \textbf{http://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu}\\
    Developed tool to measure and mitigate the frequency of plaintext password sharing in Gmail archives. The public tool allows users to redact or encrypt-in-place found passwords. The site has had over 2,500 users and has secured over 38,000 messages.

    \item[Mining in Mailboxes: Credentials Worms In The Email Domain] ~\\
    Measured the viability of an email credential worm by searching for passwords in a small set of seed email accounts, testing if those passwords give access to new accounts, and then repeating the attack. Simulated this attack using a university's email archives.

    \item[Machine Learning for 8-Bit NES Song Writing] \hfill \textbf{https://github.com/snyderp/nes-machine-learning}\\
    Automatically generated new Nintendo chip-style songs using a collection corpus of classic NES sound tracks and a song synthesizer based on hidden Markov models and a Bayesian network.
