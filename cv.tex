  \section{Research}
  \begin{description}
    \item[CRISP: Abstractions for Security Guarantees in Interactive Web Applications] ~\\
    Web users currently have few guarantees about the security properties of websites they visit, and the frequency and sophistication of attacks on web servers means that a site that is benign one day can become malicious the next, all invisibly to the client.  This project seeks to create higher level abstractions for creating HTML and Javascript applications, so that the client has guarantees about the security of the application being run, without the need for manual code inspection.

    \item[Cloudsweeper] \hfill \textbf{https://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu}\\
    Developed tool to measure and mitigate the frequency of plaintext password sharing in Gmail archives. The public tool allows users to redact or encrypt-in-place found passwords. The site has had over 2,500 users and has secured over 38,000 messages.

    \item[Mining in Mailboxes: Credentials Worms In The Email Domain] ~\\
    Measured the viability of an email credential worm by searching for passwords in a small set of seed email accounts, testing if those passwords give access to new accounts, and then repeating the attack. Simulated this attack using a university's email archives.
