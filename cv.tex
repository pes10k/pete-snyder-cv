  \section{Research}
  \begin{description}

    \item[Measuring the Amount and Costs of Browser Complexity] ~\\
    The modern web has seen an explosion in the number of browser features implemented and available to web developers.  This research measures the increased complexity imposed by these new features, the usefulness of this added complexity to users and web authors, and the cost these new features entail to user privacy and security.

    \item[CRISP: Abstractions for Security Guarantees in Interactive Web Applications] ~\\
    Web users currently have few guarantees about the security properties of websites they visit, and the frequency and sophistication of attacks on web servers means that a site that is benign one day can become malicious the next, all invisibly to the client.  This project investigates new web systems that prioritize client security and code predictability at minimal cost to web author expressivity.

    \item[Cloudsweeper] \hfill \textbf{https://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu}\\
    Developed tool to measure and mitigate the frequency of plaintext password sharing in Gmail archives. The public tool allows users to redact or encrypt-in-place found passwords. The site has had over 2,500 users and has secured over 38,000 messages.
